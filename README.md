## Pandemic Simulator
Initial conditions (such as S0, I0, and R0)  
Initial condition are set such that S0 = 99%, which indicates the proportion of susceptible individuals when the simulation starts. 
I0 is set to 1%, which indicates proportion of infected individuals to be 1% when the simulation starts. 
R0 is set to 0% which is expected that there are are no recovered individuals when the simulations start.

## Graphical Output
When the script is run the graph represents the population changes
